        <h2>Basic Machine Learning Concepts</h2>

        <h4>How do machines "learn"?</h4>
        <p>
          An ML model is basically a very complex mathematical function with [lots of] parameters (aka weights). At the beginning, these weights are usually initialized with random values (or other reasonable guesses). The "learning process" (called training) involves the following high level steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Run the ML model (i.e. compute the math function) with a batch of input data, to compute an output</li>
          <li>Evaluate the emitted output (known as the loss function)</li>
          <li>Update the parameter weights slightly to improve (reduce) the loss</li>
          <li>Go back to step 1 (stop when we are satisfied)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The idea is that with sufficient training and data using the above steps, the parameters of the complex mathematical function will converge to <b><i>good</i></b> values such that the model is able to <b><i>predict</i></b> values accurately on new data. The model <b><i>learns</i></b> and improves over time via the training process.
        </p>

            This is in contrast to normal/traditional/non-learning algorithms whose parameters are "fixed". They do not require any training, but they also do not learn from the data. They work great when we already know the computation model (true for the vast majority of code in the current world). But ML models have been able to solve a variety of problems that we don't have an intuitive sense of how to model the problem.
